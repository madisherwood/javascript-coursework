During this assignment, I used primitive data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, and nulls. 
I learned a lot but I would say the most interesting thing to me would be that converting parts of code can be different depending on what you are converting. 
For example, booleans and strings both convert entirely differeently. 
What I mean by that is when you convert a a string that has text into a boolean, it then becomes true. 
I also was unaware that null will turn into a 0 when it is converted to a number. 
Coercion surprised me because learning how JavaScript automatically converts things, shows how important it is to be careful in case of bugs. 
I used AI in this assignment to help me fugure out what my synyax errors were and how to fix them. I also used AI to give me suggestions of different ways to run my code. 
AI helped me to understand that if something is already defined in JavaScript, you can't define it again. 
Yes, I was tempted to copy AI in this assignment, but I made sure to remind myself that because this is what I plan on doing for my career, it is important that I actually learn the material. 
One concept from this lesson that I would like to further my knowledge more on would be when converting null into a number, how you get a specifc number. 
This assignment overall helped me learn and feel better about fixing errors and learning what the errors are and why they are wrong and won't work.
